## Overview

Successfully completed Task 6.2 - **完善重试策略实现** (Enhanced Retry Strategy Implementation) from the NotifyHub architecture refactor. This task focused on enhancing the retry strategy implementation from Task 6.1 with advanced features including statistics tracking, platform-specific configurations, circuit breaker patterns, and performance monitoring.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Advanced Retry Statistics and Tracking

**Enhanced RetryStatistics Structure:**
- Added comprehensive platform-specific statistics tracking
- Implemented latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99) calculation
- Added success rate and retry rate calculations
- Created rolling window tracking for performance analysis

**Key Features:**
- Platform-specific attempt tracking
- Error code classification and counting
- Circuit breaker trip monitoring
- Time-based metrics collection

### 2. Platform-Specific Retry Configurations

**PlatformRetryConfig System:**
- Implemented platform-specific retry parameters
- Added per-platform enable/disable controls
- Created dynamic configuration updates
- Integrated with conditional retry policies

**Configuration Examples:**
```go
feishuConfig := &PlatformRetryConfig{
    Platform:    "feishu",
    MaxAttempts: 5,
    BaseDelay:   2 * time.Second,
    MaxDelay:    30 * time.Second,
    Multiplier:  2.0,
    Jitter:      0.2,
    Enabled:     true,
}
```
